One day, Ben was walking through the store when he came across a very special vase. When Ben saw it he was amazed!  He said, “Wow, that is a really amazing vase! Can I buy it?” The shopkeeper smiled and said, “Of course you can. You can take it home and show all your friends how amazing it is!”So Ben took the vase home and he was so proud of it! He called his friends over and showed them the amazing vase. All his friends thought the vase was beautiful and couldn't believe how lucky Ben was. And that's how Ben found an amazing vase in the store!\n"
